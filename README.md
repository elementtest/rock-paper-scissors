# rock-paper-scissors
READ FIRST
this code is written by 'Coding with Rob' on Youtube.  I followed along entering exactly what he did as a refresher for javascript considering I have not practiced in a long time.  Most of my time has been spent with learning JS DOM recently.

MISCALLANEOUS NOTES FOR MYSELF BELOW:::::::::::::::::::::
USE A .PLAN file for miscallaneous notes on project planning/creation 
I now plan to follow along with the odin project on creating a UI possibly for the rock paper scissors game that was produced from following along with Rob's videos.  I do not claim any of the code as my own, this is purely for practice.  



rock paper scissors game from the odin project

Re doing the project to remind myself of the concepts (did months ago)

After working rock paper scissors script is written a ui will be added

updated vscode workspace to include prettier formatting and starting to use 
LIVE SERVER extension which needs to be configured a bit... i.e need to default it to open with the chrome browser and not the firefox browser

SUCCESS edited it to open with the chrome browser instead of the firefox browser.  

will continue to find tools that help with work flow... have already added quite a few.. BASH scripts for one.. that is a big one, firefox extensions that is two, the link hints extension to make it so that i dont have to use the mouse to open links and also the save working session link which i will now use for variable webpages that i need to open.  The main pages that I need to open will be done in the BASH script on the desktop but for anything else i will just use the save working session extension.  

in addition to those work flow improvements.  I also have the vscode extensions.  I implemented VIM just recently... and what else? prettier extension which i need to play around with.  and the live server extension which will make editing and displaying changes in the browser a lot better and a lot less pain.  

also added reset.css which basically a css style sheet that makes it more compatible across browsers
