# rock-paper-scissors
rock paper scissors game from the odin project

Re doing the project to remind myself of the concepts (did months ago)

After working rock paper scissors script is written a ui will be added

updated vscode workspace to include prettier formatting and starting to use 
LIVE SERVER extension which needs to be configured a bit... i.e need to default it to open with the chrome browser and not the firefox browser

also added reset.css which basically a css style sheet that makes it more compatible across browsers
