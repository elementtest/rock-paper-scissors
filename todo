a
remove logic that plays 5 rounds 
X
b
make each div clickable (not just the text)


create three buttons.  
one for rock
one for paper
one for scissors

add event listener to each one

event listener calls PlayRound Function 
with correct selection added

c
add a div (display results and change all console.log into DOM methods)

d 
display a running score, announce the winner of a game once player reaches 5 points
(you will have to rework the code to make this work)

e
when done commit changes to the rps-ui branch


NOTES:
select button: 
once button is selected make playerChoice input = to the same thing as the inputso how do we do that?
